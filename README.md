# HDR-Imaging
This project is about producing a tone-mapped version of High Dynamic Range (HDR) image from three Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images. An autoencoder with three encoders and one decoder were used in this project. Additionally, this code is an implementation of the article called Deep Autoencoder Multi-Exposure HDR Imaging, which can be found on the following DOI:
